1.2 release of ``The Macro Implementation of SNOBOL4 in C'' (CSNOBOL4)

This is a free port of the original SIL (SNOBOL4 Implementation
Language) "macro" version of SNOBOL4 (developed at Bell Labs) with the
`C' language as a target.

SNOBOL4, while known primarily as a string language excels at any task
involving symbolic manipulations.  It provides run time typing,
garbage collection, user data types, on the fly compilation.  It's
primary weakness is it's simple syntax, and lack of "structured
programming" and "object oriented" constructs.

However some consider the spareness of SNOBOL4 syntax a strength when
compared to some "modern" agglomerations such as Perl.

The latest release can be found at http://www.snobol4.org

Mark Emmer has made his old 16-bit DOS Macro SNOBOL4 based product
"SNOBOL4+" available for free.  See http://www.snobol4.com and
ftp://ftp.snobol4.com for it, many demo programs, SNOBOL4 language
documentation, and ordering information for books & products from
Catspaw!

Mark Emmer also runs a SNOBOL4 mailing list;

To join the list, send a mail message to "listserv@mercury.dsu.edu"
with the line "subscribe SNOBOL4 Your Name" as the message body.
"Your Name" should be your real name (your e-mail address will be used
automatically for the subscription).

Submissions to the list may be sent to "SNOBOL4@mercury.dsu.edu".

To be removed from the list, send the message "unsubscribe SNOBOL4" to
"listserv@mercury.dsu.edu".

For more information see http://www.snobol4.com/listserv.htm

Acknowledgments;

	First and foremost, I would like to thank Ralph Griswold, for
	all his invaluable help and time digging up old documentation!
	(as well as his work of 30 years ago, designing and
	implementing the language)!

	I would also never have succeeded without the help of Mark
	Emmer of Catspaw and his excellent SPARC SPITBOL product!!

	The contributions of source code by Mark Emmer (SNOBOL4+) and
	Viktors Berstis (Minnesota SNOBOL4) have allowed me to advance
	the state of CSNOBOL4 in ways that would have been otherwise
	impossible.

The following have also provided help, encouragement, support, input,
historical background, testing, fixes, money, etc (in chronological order);

	Bill Henneman
	Andrew Koenig
	Doug McIlroy
	Robert Dewar
	Alan Martin
	Jerry Leichter
	Scott Marovich
	Jonathan Chandross
	Randolph J. Herber
	Jules Gilbert
	Phillip Lee Thomas
	Martin D. Waller
	Burkhard Meissner
	John McHugh
	Chrystopher Nehaniv

If you make any changes/fixes/improvements, or port it to a new
system, please send them to me (please include "timing.out" and tell
me the system type, CPU clock speed, C compiler & version)!!

If you are interested in getting mailings about new releases, send me
mail.  I'm interested in knowing what people are using SNOBOL4 for!
