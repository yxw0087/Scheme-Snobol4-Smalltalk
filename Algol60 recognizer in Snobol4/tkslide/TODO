in random order:
----------------
- better syntax highlighting
- configuration file documentation
- multiple s4 options (checkboxes?)
- project support
- user-defined screen configuration
- Baloon helps for snobol4 keywords?
- resizable in/out/error frames? 
	- or maybe vertically stacked in/out/err frames?
- separate documentation pack (optional download?)
- "goto procedure definition", like in ML editor (see wiki.tcl.tk).
- test it with Catspaws Snobol4? Does anybody care? [Ask?]
- who can test it with Spitbol? Announcement - webpage? mailgroup?
- what with interactivity? (is the expect package the one and only way to implement it?)
- *PORTABLE* intelligent browser recognition (use the systems default HTML browser - very complicated under Windows)
- Function creator
- Data creator (definition + accessors)
- starkit package?
- update documentation
