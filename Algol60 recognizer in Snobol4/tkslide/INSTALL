Zero install package
--------------------
Good news -- if you are using the "zero-install" version of the package
all you have to do is to change to the program directory and start 'slide'


Installation
------------
Well, you have to have TCL installed.
Just unzip/untar it, adjust your PATH (if needed).

Configuration
-------------
There is only one system-wide configuration file (tksliderc in installation
directory and one user configuration file in user's "HOME" 
UNIX: $HOME/.tksliderc
WINDOWS: {your profile folder}\tksliderc

You can copy the example_tksliderc file to the proper location and adjust it
with your favorite editor

You will *have to* specify the full path name of your browser.

Platform-specific
-----------------
UNIX:
- The file should be executable (use chmod +x tkslide.tcl if needed).
- If your 'wish' executable isn't '/usr/bin/wish' adjust the first line of
tkslide.tcl.
