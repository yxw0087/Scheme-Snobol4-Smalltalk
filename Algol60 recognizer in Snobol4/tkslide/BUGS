Known bugs:
- WINDOWS: Spitbol interpreter seems to dislike windows style paths with spaces. 
  If you plan to use spitbol with tkslide store "tkslide" folder in location 
  without spaces (like "c:\tkslide" or "e:\tmp\tkslide")

- cannot start with eTcl 1 rc 23

- not exactly a bug -- it doesn't work with 16bit SNOBOLs from Catspaw, Inc. 

- syntax highlighting needs some significant reworking.

- there's no 'maximize' button under KDE 3.2.x w/TCL 8.4.4.
  Fix: update TCL to 8.4.7+
  Workaround: Resize manually 

- interactive (using keyboard entry) programs may hang the IDE

- to stop program which entered endless loop one has to kill the snobol4
  process.
